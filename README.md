# Wox.SwitchWindows
A window switcher for Wox that works on Windows 10



Command is invoked with "sw \<window title>"

Command can be installed by downloading wox file and dragging it into Wox's main search window

Command has pack script if you want to build from source. The pack script just needs to zip up all files in the bin folder and then needs to be renamed from .zip -> .wox. The script uses 7zip for zipping but if you don't have installed you can do manually as well.
